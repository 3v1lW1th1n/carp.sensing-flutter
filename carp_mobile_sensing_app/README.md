# CARP Mobile Sensing App

The CARP Mobile Sensing App provides an example on how to use the [`carp_mobile_sensing` package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_mobile_sensing).
The app sets up a `Study` that starts a set of `Probe`s and visualize the data. The UI of the app is shown below, showing
(from left to right) the Study Visualization page, the Probe List page, and the Data Visualization page.
